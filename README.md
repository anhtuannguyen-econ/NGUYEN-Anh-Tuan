# Personal website (GitHub Pages) — v2 (Tabs + Light theme)

## Publish
1. Upload these files to your repo root (same level as `index.html`)
2. GitHub → Settings → Pages → ensure it deploys from the correct branch

## Photo not showing?
- Make sure the file exists exactly at: `assets/headshot.jpg` (case-sensitive)
- The `assets` folder must be committed/pushed
- In a project site (like /NGUYEN-Anh-Tuan/), use relative paths like `./assets/headshot.jpg` (already set)

## Tabs
This version shows one section at a time (About/Research/Publications/Teaching/Projects/Contact).
You can link directly to a tab using hashes, e.g. `.../index.html#publications`.
